### Lesson Overview - Use the Cloud

Thanks to the Internet, we can store information from one device and access it using another, almost instantly. **The cloud** is a collection of software services that run across the world using the Internet, instead of running on a single user's computer.

Storing content on the cloud makes it easier to access our information from anywhere,Â instead of storing it locally, or only on our computer.
