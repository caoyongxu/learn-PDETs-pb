You will often need to find information online without knowing the website or URL. **Search engines** solve this problem and allow you to search through large collections of content to find what you are looking for.

There are a variety of search engines available, but you can use all web search engines in the same way.

### Try It Yourself

Use a search engine to search for the term "Space Needle".  Notice the different types of websites you are presented with.  Can you find the Space Needle hours of operation?

### Search Tips

Search engines search through millions of webpages and often provide you with thousands of results that match your search. It can be difficult to browse through a large number of results to find the type of content you are looking for.

Search engines do their best to provide you with results that seem most useful to you, but they can't always predict what you're looking for.

There are some techniques you can use to help the search engine provide you with results that are relevant, so that you don't waste time looking through webpages that don't match what you're looking for.

**Watch the following video to learn tips for searching effectively.**

### Try It Yourself

Use a search engine to find the height of Mount Rainier  If you have a friend or classmate nearby, challenge them to see who will find the answer first.  

*   What search term helped find the right answer?  
*   Were there any search terms that weren't as helpful?  
*   Were there any search term suggestions that helped you word your search?  

### Evaluate Online Information

As you browse through search results and content on the web, it's important to be aware of the types of content you might come across. Anyone can create content on the web, so you can't trust everything you come across.

Once you navigate to a webpage to look for information, you should be critical in evaluating the accuracy and credibility of the content.

Information is **accurate** if you can verify that it is true.

Information is **credible** if you can trust the source that published the content.

**Watch the following video to learn more about how you can determine the credibility and authenticity of information you find online.**
