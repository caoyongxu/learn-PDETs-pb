There are many operating systems provided by many companies in the world. Each operating system is designed to work on specific types of devices. For example:

*   **Windows** is designed by Microsoft. It is a family of operating systems that can run on a variety of PCs and laptops. We will use the Windows 10 version of this operating system for demos in this course.
*   **MacOS** is designed by Apple Inc. and works on Apple's Macintosh computers like the MacBook.
*   **iOS** is designed by Apple Inc. and works on Apple's mobile devices like iPhone, iPod and iPad devices.
*   **Android OS** is designed by Google and works mainly on touchscreen mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.
*   **Google Chrome OS** is designed by Google and works on Chromebook devices.

Virtual assistants are digital services that help you to perform tasks on your computer, like setting reminders, checking the weather, and searching the web.  Virtual assistants are built into the operating systems of many modern devices.  Some of the most popular virtual assistants are Microsoft Cortana, Apple Siri and Google Assistant.

Virtual assistants use AI or artificial intelligence to learn more about you, so they become more helpful the more you continue to use them. You can use virtual assistants on your desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone or other supported devices such as smart speakers.  To make interactions easier, you can often interact with virtual assistants using voice commands.
