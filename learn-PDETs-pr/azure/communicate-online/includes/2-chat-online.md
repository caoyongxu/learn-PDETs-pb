### Intro to IM, Voice and Video Calling

There are many ways to stay in touch with friends, family and others online. You will typically communicate in different ways depending on the situation. For example, email is typically used in professional or formal scenarios, like communicating with a business client or with your professor.

There are other ways to communicate that can be useful in different scenarios. **Instant messaging (IM)** is a way to chat with someone instantly, as if you're in the middle of a live conversation. Online **Voice calling (VOIP)** is a way to make calls using the Web without using a landline or cellular network, although you can call others using their phone number. With **video calling** you can use a web camera to see the person you're talking to online.
