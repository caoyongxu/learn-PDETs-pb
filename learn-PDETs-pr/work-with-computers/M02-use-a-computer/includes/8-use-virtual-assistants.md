### Use Virtual Assistants
Virtual assistants are digital services that help you to perform tasks on your computer, like setting reminders, checking the weather, and searching the web.  Virtual assistants are built into the operating systems of many modern devices.  Some of the most popular virtual assistants are Microsoft Cortana, Apple Siri and Google Assistant.

Virtual assistants use AI or artificial intelligence to learn more about you, so they become more helpful the more you continue to use them. You can use virtual assistants on your desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone or other supported devices such as smart speakers.  To make interactions easier, you can often interact with virtual assistants using voice commands.
