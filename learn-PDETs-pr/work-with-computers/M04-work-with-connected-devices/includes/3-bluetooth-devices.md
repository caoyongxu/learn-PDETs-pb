### Bluetooth Devices

With modern technology, we can connect peripheral devices to our computers without using cables.  Bluetooth is a wireless technology that makes this possible.  If a device is bluetooth enabled, you can connect it to a bluetooth enabled computer with the press of a button.

Using bluetooth, you can connect wireless headphones to your computer and listen to music without plugging anything in, or connect a keyboard to your computer without any cables.  You can even connect both via Bluetooth at the same time.

Many laptops and tablets have Bluetooth support built-in.  If you're using a computer that doesn't have Bluetooth, you can plug a separate USB Bluetooth adapter into the USB port to enable Bluetooth.
